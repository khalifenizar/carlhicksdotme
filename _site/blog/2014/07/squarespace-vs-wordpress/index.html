      <p>Today I was having a conversation with a graphic designer and somehow we ended up on the topic of blogging technology. I say somehow because this particular designer medium of choose is generally ‘physical’ rather then web (i.e. print). He suggested for that for small quick projects that he’d be handing over to the client to maintain WordPress, hosted on a big box hosting service, was the best solution for his clients. This somewhat throw me for a loop because I know for a fact that he at least knew what Squarespace had to offer.<br />
<br />
While I have no issues with WordPress, some of my favorite sites/blogs were created using the platform and live on the platform to this day, I could not understand why you would hand over a site that you did not intend to maintain to a client, with no development skills, built on WordPress. This was not a conversation of which platform was more technically superior but rather a discussion on the easy of use for none web designers/developers. In my head I though this is almost a no brainer when you compare both platforms/hosting solutions. However after spending an half an hour going back and forth over this topic I conceded due to the fact that I had much better things to waste time on. Walking away from this conversation though I started to think more about this topic and wanted to see if I just had not given WordPress a good look in a while. So down that rabbit hole I went looking to see if it was just me or was I just ‘fanboy’ trying to side with my platform of choice.<br />
<br />
I started by asking around and trying to figure out ‘what was the most commonly used WordPress setup?’ Anecdotally I came up with WordPress hosted on Go Daddy’s managed hosting service, based on asking twenty different people building websites for small to medium size businesses.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> While Go Daddy’s managed hosting services/website builder does offer click and point setup along with WordPress core updates the service still requires some level of knowledge to setup and and maintain. On the other hand Squarespace out of the gate offers pretty much everything you need to run a website with no knowledge at all. So rather then continuing and asking around for the sake of proving something I already know, I did what I should have done from the start and did a search on the comparison between the two services:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.websitebuilderexpert.com/squarespace-vs-wordpress/">• Squarespace = less maintenance and lower cost in the long run <br />
<br />
• WordPress = more flexibility, but higher maintenance, higher learning curve and cost more in the long run </a>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>First hit pretty much described what I though it would along with pretty much everyone after.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> I could go on and on but I think at this point its clear do the search and you be the judge. I am almost sure I know where anyone with half a brain will end up if they are searching for a simple to use website solution.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>  </p>

<hr />

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>While their were some digital designers in this sample, most of them would not consider themselves as web designer/developers so there technical skills tilted more toward beginner to novice on the technical spectrum when dealing with platform and hosting technologies.   <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>While WordPress is a extremely flexible and platform this article was based on an older version of Squarespace and Sqaurespace has since added developer mode allowing for full flexibility over your code to the point where I’d argue that it is just as powerful if not more.   <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:3">
      <p>I would host pretty much any costumer site on Spacespace unless I had a technical reason not to … but that is just my own opinion. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
